Date=2005-10-27T19:40:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}'
which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file
which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

[V 1.24]

[V 1.23]
Date=2003-03-23T11:29:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Move demos into examples/ directory
- No source code changes in this version
- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros because the
PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro
which means it does not index the module and this in turn means
the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list etc.

[V 1.10]
Date=1999-03-28T12:11:25
Comments= <<EOT
- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
Use h2xs to generate the skeleton for Tree.pm.
Rename testDirTree.pl to dirTree.pl.
Rename testCppTree.pl to cppTree.pl.
Put code from dirTree.pl & cppTree.pl into test.pl.
V 1.10 attempts to write to the current directory if it cannot write to the directory
containing the *.h files. This makes it possible to run testCppTree.pl (say) and input
a directory on CDROM.
