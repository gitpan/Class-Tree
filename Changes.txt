1.20 27-Jun-99
--------------
o Thanks to CPAN testers

	writeClassList(). My apologies for not including this earlier

1.13 19-Apr-99

1.10  Sun Mar 28 12:11:25 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

Use h2xs to generate the skeleton for Tree.pm.

Rename testDirTree.pl to dirTree.pl.
Rename testCppTree.pl to cppTree.pl.

Put code from dirTree.pl & cppTree.pl into test.pl.

V 1.10 attempts to write to the current directory if it cannot write to the directory
containing the *.h files. This makes it possible to run testCppTree.pl (say) and input
a directory on CDROM.
